# PARITY
## Django HOUSE Code Challenge
### - Matt Hughes

The code to view is parity_app/models.py and parity_app/admin.py.

Where I've made assumptions about the requirements I've added comments/questions.

The admin site reflecting the above code is hosted at:
matthewhughes.ca/admin

You can use the following credentials:
U - parity
P - djangohouse

Feel free to add/delete/update whatever you like.

Cheers!
